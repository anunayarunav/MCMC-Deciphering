Best Guesses : 
Pirst Nitizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

Pirst Nitizen:
Rou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Desolved. resolved.

Pirst Nitizen:
Pirst, you know Naius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

Pirst Nitizen:
Het us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
Vo more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Nitizen:
One word, good citizens.

Pirst Nitizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Het us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Nitizen:
Would you proceed especially against Naius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

Second Nitizen:
Nonsider you what services he has done for his country?

Pirst Nitizen:
Gery well; and could be content to give him good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Nitizen:
Vay, but speak not maliciously.

Pirst Nitizen:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Nitizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. Rou must in no way say he is covetous.

Pirst Nitizen:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Napitol!

All:
Nome, come.

Pirst Nitizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second Nitizen:
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.

Pirst Nitizen:
Le's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!

MXVXVIZS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

Pirst Nitizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.

MXVXVIZS:
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?

Pirst Nitizen:
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

MXVXVIZS:
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Lave the patricians of you. Por your wants,
Rour suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Doman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. Por the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Rour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
Rou are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

Pirst Nitizen:
Nare for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.

MXVXVIZS:
Xither you must
Nonfess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

Pirst Nitizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
you, deliver.

MXVXVIZS:
There was a time when all the body's members
Debell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Hike labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Eid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Znto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--

Pirst Nitizen:
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MXVXVIZS:...
Pirst Nitizen:
